Human: Let $x$ , $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_xw=24$ , $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz}w=12$ . Find $\log_zw$ . To solve the problem, we will use properties of logarithms. Given:

\[
\log_x w = 24
\]
\[
\log_y w = 40
\]
\[
\log_{xyz} w = 12
\]

We need to find \(\log_z w\).

First, recall the change of base formula for logarithms:
\[
\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}
\]

Using this, we can express each given logarithm in terms of base 10 (or any other common base):
\[
\log_x w = \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24
\]
\[
\log_y w = \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40
\]
\[
\log_{xyz} w = \frac{\log w}{\log (xyz)} = 12
\]

From \(\log_x w = 24\), we have:
\[
\log w = 24 \log x
\]

Similarly, from \(\log_y w = 40\), we have:
\[
\log w = 40 \log y
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\log w\):
\[
24 \log x = 40 \log y
\]

Solving for \(\log x\) in terms of \(\log y\):
\[
\log x = \frac{40}{24} \log y = \frac{5}{3} \log y
\]

Next, consider \(\log_{xyz} w = 12\):
\[
\log w = 12 \log (xyz)
\]

Using the property \(\log (abc) = \log a + \log b + \log c\), we get:
\[
\log (xyz) = \log x + \log y + \log z
\]

Thus:
\[
\log w = 12 (\log x + \log y + \log z)
\]

Now, we have three equations involving \(\log w\):
1. \(\log w = 24 \log x\)
2. \(\log w = 40 \log y\)
3. \(\log w = 12 (\log x + \log y + \log z)\)

Human: Let $f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|$ , where $0 < p < 15$ . Determine the minimum value taken by $f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $p \leq x\leq15$ . To solve this, we need to consider different cases based on the value of $x$ relative to $p$, $15$, and $p+15$. 

1. When $x \geq p+15$, the expression simplifies to $f(x) = (x - p) + (x - 15) + (x - p - 15) = 3x - 2p - 30$.
2. When $p \leq x < p+15$, the expression simplifies to $f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (x - p - 15) = x - p + 15 - x + x - p - 15 = x - 2p$.
3. When $x < p$, the expression simplifies to $f(x) = (p - x) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = 3p + 30 - 3x$.

Now we need to evaluate these expressions within their respective intervals to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.

Let's start by evaluating $f(x)$ at the boundaries of each interval.
To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15| \) for \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function in the specified interval. The key points to consider are the values of \( x \) at which the expressions inside the absolute values change sign, i.e., at \( x = p \), \( x = 15 \), and \( x = p + 15 \).

Since \( p \) is between 0 and 15, \( p + 15 \) is greater than 15. Therefore, within the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we only need to consider the expressions:
1. For \( p \leq x < 15 \):
\[ f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (x - p - 15) = x - p + 15 - x + x - p - 15 = x - 2p. \]
This simplifies to \( f(x) = x -",-100000000000000000000
